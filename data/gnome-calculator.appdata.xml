      GNOME Calculator is an application that solves mathematical equations.  Though it at first appears to be a simple calculator with only basic arithmetic operations, you can switch into Advanced, Financial, or Programming mode to find a surprising set of capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Advanced calculator supports many operations, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>logarithms</li>
    <li>factorials</li>
    <li>trigonometric and hyperbolic trigonometric functions</li>
    <li>modulus (remainder) division</li>
    <li>complex numbers</li>
    <li>random number generation</li>
    <li>prime factorization</li>
    <li>unit conversions (angle, length, area, volume, weight, duration, temperature, currency, and time)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Financial mode supports several computations, including periodic interest rate, present and future value, double declining and straight line depreciation, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming mode supports conversion between common bases (binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal), boolean algebra, one’s and two’s complementation, character to character code conversion, and more.
